Python and XSLT scripts supporting a desktop workflow for harvesting Long Term Ecological Research program datasets via the PASTA API and packaging for batch ingest into a DSpace repository.

A scriptable XML parser is required for the batch packaging process. The current packaging script includes calls to the Saxon Home Edition http://www.saxonica.com/download/opensource.xml.
